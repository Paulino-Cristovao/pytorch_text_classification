# Dataset Information for Text Classification

This directory contains the dataset used for the text classification project. Below are the details regarding the dataset:

## Source
- The dataset is sourced from [insert dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.].

## Format
- The dataset is in [insert format here, e.g., CSV, JSON, etc.].
- It contains the following columns:
  - `text`: The text data to be classified.
  - `label`: The corresponding label for the text data.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove any unnecessary characters, HTML tags, or special symbols.
2. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
3. **Lowercasing**: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
4. **Stopword Removal**: Remove common words that do not contribute to the meaning (e.g., "and", "the", etc.).
5. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form.

Please ensure to follow these preprocessing steps before using the dataset for training the model.
