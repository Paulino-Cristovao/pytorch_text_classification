```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd text-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Use the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks` directory to run the text classification tasks interactively.
- The `src` directory contains the core functionality, including model definition and training scripts.
- Refer to the `data/README.md` for details about the dataset used in this project.
